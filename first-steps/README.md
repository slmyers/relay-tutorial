### First Steps

In this repository we will explore relay step-by-step. 
We are currently on `step 0`. In this step we setup a simple Relay app.
The app will reteive a mock user, Stringify it and post to screen.

`yarn start`: starts app with reload
`yarn update:schema`: generates a GraphQL Schema `schema.graphql`

The code is heavily commented.
